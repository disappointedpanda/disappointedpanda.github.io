		<h1>The Origami Flapping Bird</h1>
		<p>This relatively simple flapping bird is easy to make and can provide <br>
			hours of joy to children and adults alike!  Learn how to make it below!
		</p>
		<h2>Step One: First Folds</h2>
		<p>Starting with a <a href="../basic">bird base</a>, fold up the legs as shown. <br>
			Make sure that the folded edges remain flush</p>

		<h2>Step Two: Making the Neck and Tail</h2>
		<p>Next, unfold the previous folds.  On one side, reverse one of the folds and tuck <br>
		the leg in.  Repeat with the other leg.</p>

		<h2>Step Three: Adjusting the Tail</h2>
		<p>Next, choose a side to become the tail, and pivot the leg so that the corner is in the <br>
		middle of the leg.  Check the diagram:</p>

		<h2>Step Four: Folding the Head</h2>
		<p>With the side you chose to be the neck, open and fold down the tip so it stick out as <br>
		the head.  Then, close the neck:</p>

		<h2>Step Five: Fold the Wings Down.</h2>
		<p>Next, you will need  to fold the wings along the guidelines.</p>

		<img class="resize" src="images/flappingbird8.jpg" alt="A picture with both wings folded down"/>
		
		<h2>Step Six: Fly!</h2>
		<p>Next, you will unfold the creases you just made on the wing and hold where the stars are in <br>
			the photo. Gently pull the tail out to make the bird flap!</p>
