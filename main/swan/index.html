	<h1>The Origami Swan</h1>
	<p>This simple and elegant origami swan is easy to make, but very impressive. <br>
	You can learn how to make it below!</p>
	
	<h2>Step One: Getting Started</h2>
	<p>To make a swan, you will need to start with a square piece of paper</p>

	<h2>Step Two: Preliminary Folds</h2>
	<p>Next, you must fold the paper in half diagonally, and fold two of the raw <br> 
	edges to that crease</p>
